# 🃏 UNO Game from Scratch

An implementation of the classic UNO card game built entirely from scratch using Java.

This project aims to replicate the core gameplay mechanics of UNO, providing a functional, console-based, or potentially a GUI-based (depending on the code in `src`) application experience.

## ✨ Features

Based on the file structure, the project is likely to include the following features:

* **Core UNO Rules:** Implementation of all standard UNO rules, including numbering cards, skip, reverse, draw two, and wild cards.
* **Multi-Player Support:** Logic for handling multiple players.
* **User Accounts/Profiles:** The presence of `accounts.txt` suggests player profiles or simple account management.
* **Game Persistence:** Ability to save and load games (indicated by the `SavedGames` directory).
* **Game Logging:** Detailed recording of game events (indicated by the `Logs` directory).
